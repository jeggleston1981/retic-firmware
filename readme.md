# IoT Reticulation Controller
This is a standalone code for a 4 channel reticulation controller, the controller already works with Home Assistants ESPhome.  This is repo is if you would like to use it stand alone if you are not running home assistant or if you would just like to have it stand alone so that it is not network dependent.
To use this code you will need to have a RTC module installed such as the DS3231 or MAX31328 the later which is available from my website www.egglec.com.au
